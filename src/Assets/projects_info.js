  "Hey, my name is Elijah! My path to web development began in 2020 during the pandemic while completing my bachelor's degree in Business Administration. I had a few fun projects that I wanted to pursue, but found myself confined to Wix and similar services. As the phrase goes, 'If you want something done, you have to do it yourself.' I shifted my focus from business to web development and started at Flatiron, a software engineering bootcamp. I am looking forward to the challenges and excitement that a career in software engineering offers.";
